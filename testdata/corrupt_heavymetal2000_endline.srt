1
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:22,811
Long ago,
the Arakacians ruled the galaxies.

2
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:26,685
Horror and devastation lay in their wake.

3
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:30,248
The source of their terrifying power...

4
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:33,570
...lay within a chamber on planet Uroboris.

5
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:39,687
The waters it contained
held the promise of everlasting life.

6
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:44,929
The chamber could only be opened
with a single key...

7
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:47,208
...which, if ever found...

8
00:01:47,693 --> 00:01:52,721
...would guide its bearer back
to the fountainhead of immortality.

9
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:58,850
However, the key would drive
all who touched it insane.

10
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:04,924
When the Arakacians were finally defeated,
the chamber was locked...

11
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:09,092
...and the key, cast out deep into space.

12
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:12,242
It has never been found...

13
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:15,043
...until now.

14
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:43,848
Give it up, why don't ya!

15
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:47,928
Damn! Not again!

16
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:54,206
I can't wait to get
those new matter munchers.

17
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:57,611
I've had just about enough
of these cheap heads.

18
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:14,651
Tyler, major find here!

19
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:16,002
What is it?

20
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:21,252
I don't know.

21
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:39,811
Careful, it could be a Class 4 biohazard.

22
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:42,251
What is that thing?

23
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:46,126
What's it doing?

24
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:10,249
It's weird.

25
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:24,932
What's going on?

26
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:27,162
Are you okay?

27
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:31,008
Should I call for a containment crew?

28
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:37,282
No, please!

29
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,086
The guardian has revealed himself!
The key has been found!

30
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:14,726
Odin, tell us. Is the day
of the great darkness at hand?

31
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:20,047
Yes. It is written in the Old Books.
The coming back time has begun.

32
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,889
Evil will descend upon us!

33
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:27,448
We must prepare to defend the chamber!

34
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:49,651
Sanders, sector 3!

35
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:52,732
We're still waiting
for their preliminary core samples.

36
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,247
What? How long
have they been down there?

37
00:06:55,453 --> 00:06:58,286
Over 12 hours. They must be going nuts.

38
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:04,452
Weird. System checks out,
but no response. Deadsville.

39
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:08,004
Send someone down there.
I want to know what's going on.

40
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:11,042
I need a big ship to get somewhere.

41
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:13,204
What the hell do you think you're doing?

42
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:14,885
Security. To the bridge!

43
00:07:24,213 --> 00:07:25,931
Any other stupid questions?

44
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:33,367
You, fat boy. Name and duties.

45
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:37,045
- Lambert, sir. Navigation's Officer.
- Drive.

46
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:40,532
Germain St. Germain.

47
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:43,605
When I want your name, shit brain,
I'll ask for it.

48
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:45,371
Take over engineering.

49
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:48,526
Plot a course for BR-549, sector 7.

50
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,887
And somebody better
get rid of this garbage.

51
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:57,602
By the way...

52
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:01,407
...you have 20 seconds
to get us out of here.

53
00:11:48,813 --> 00:11:49,802
Hi.

54
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:51,565
What are you still doing here?

55
00:11:51,653 --> 00:11:54,087
I know. I'm going to be late for school.

56
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,482
Where's Dad?

57
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:58,571
He's at the council meeting.
I thought you were supposed to go.

58
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:17,013
Do you believe
any of that immortality crap?

59
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:20,048
Think about it. A stupid key?

60
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,884
Call him a liar, and see what happens.

61
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:25,441
Listen, this guy's getting weirder
by the day.

62
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:28,331
Imagine in 10 years? Hell, 100.

63
00:12:29,693 --> 00:12:31,092
You've got a point.

64
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:35,007
I am getting sick of it.
Going all over the bloody place.

65
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:37,649
Looking for a stupid compound!

66
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:43,651
- What have you got?
- A FAKK 2 planet, sir.

67
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:47,246
Death to all carbon based life forms.

68
00:12:48,773 --> 00:12:51,924
Federation Assigned Kitogenic Killzone
to the second level.

69
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:54,368
Which means it's a dead planet.

70
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,001
Scan it anyway.

71
00:12:58,293 --> 00:12:59,726
I don't get it.

72
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:02,045
There's life out there.

73
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:05,045
The FAKK 2 must have been
from an old registry.

74
00:13:05,293 --> 00:13:08,649
I want a bio-scan for compound H20-471.

75
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:18,927
There are small traces in their systems.

76
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:22,688
Yeah. Immortality all over the place.

77
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:24,602
You!

78
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:27,442
Just remember you're not immortal yet!

79
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,645
What's this place called?

80
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:34,808
Eden, sir.

81
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:39,165
Welcome to paradise.

82
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:49,483
And our irrigation program
is already showing promise.

83
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:53,483
Agro-production is up five percent
in the last six months.

84
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:56,168
Phase two of our expansion project...

85
00:13:56,253 --> 00:14:00,451
...the development of the Noma Valley,
will begin in three weeks as scheduled.

86
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:04,448
Things look good, ladies and gentlemen.
Our future is bright.

87
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:23,529
- Help Kerrie. I'll get our air defences up!
- Be careful! I'll see you up there!

88
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:28,686
Quickly. This way!

89
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:03,562
Kerrie!

90
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:10,448
Julie.

91
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:13,082
Father!

92
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,765
Looks like the boys
got a little trigger-happy.

93
00:17:57,453 --> 00:18:00,650
When making an omelette,
one breaks a few eggs.

94
00:18:08,773 --> 00:18:10,764
Here, let me help you.

95
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,489
They attacked.

96
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:19,762
- You okay?
- We never had a chance.

97
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:24,368
Hey, look at this! A live one!

98
00:18:25,413 --> 00:18:26,687
Leave her alone!

99
00:18:33,453 --> 00:18:36,286
Get off of me! Let me go!

100
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,847
Feisty and sexy.

101
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:48,533
Careful boys, this one's a keeper.

102
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,164
- Pack 'em up!
- Yes, sir!

103
00:18:52,613 --> 00:18:55,002
Splitsville, boys! We're moving out!

104
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:06,441
Wait for me!

105
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:09,527
Lover-boy, you're on your own.

106
00:19:09,853 --> 00:19:12,242
You can't just leave me here like this!

107
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:15,045
Wait a minute, man-

108
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:23,645
Like the sign says, a dead planet.

109
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:56,252
This won't hurt. It's just a DNA test.

110
00:19:56,373 --> 00:19:59,092
The good stuff comes later.

111
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,485
Start with the others, Doc.

112
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:07,521
- This one's special.
- But of course.

113
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:11,729
What I need is in your system.

114
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:13,885
Not enough to make you immortal...

115
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:18,967
...but it probably keeps your people
beautiful and healthy. Especially you.

116
00:20:19,693 --> 00:20:21,524
I'll save you for last.

117
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:24,770
And if you're lucky, my dear,
and play your cards right...

118
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:27,890
...we'll spend a lot of quality time together.

119
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:39,250
Perfect. I knew
you wouldn't disappoint me.

120
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:43,407
Clean her up!

121
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:46,242
And I don't have to remind your kind...

122
00:20:46,973 --> 00:20:48,372
...she's mine.

123
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:33,451
I should have been a cook!

124
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,564
Try this for an appetiser!

125
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:39,929
- I didn't do anything! I swear!
- You're one of them!

126
00:22:40,013 --> 00:22:43,289
No! I mean, I was, but I ran away!
I didn't kill anybody!

127
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:44,647
Who did this?

128
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:47,201
He took over our ship
and forced us to come here!

129
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:49,249
- Who?
- His name's Tyler!

130
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,527
Why did he attack?

131
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:53,286
He's nuts!
He thinks he's going to live forever!

132
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:57,247
Where did he go? You've got one second.

133
00:22:57,853 --> 00:22:58,808
One...

134
00:23:00,173 --> 00:23:02,004
Wait! I'll take you to him!

135
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:04,249
- Where?
- Do we have a deal?

136
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:11,444
- How long to fix this Spacehawk?
- Two hours, max! I'm almost there.

137
00:23:14,213 --> 00:23:17,762
You dropped your wrench.
Aren't you going to pick it up?

138
00:23:18,693 --> 00:23:19,648
Yeah.

139
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,092
What did I do?

140
00:23:43,053 --> 00:23:44,645
I am a genius.

141
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:49,408
Doc, this had better work.

142
00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:01,929
I like the hint of lemon.

143
00:24:03,013 --> 00:24:04,332
I'm so glad.

144
00:24:06,373 --> 00:24:07,488
Yes!

145
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:18,292
So, where are we going?

146
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:22,527
He said he needed to get to a jump port.

147
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:25,406
Computer, set co-ordinates
for the closest spaceport...

148
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:27,768
...that can handle a class C vessel.

149
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:32,092
Searching. Confirmed.
Neo Calcutta. Course set.

150
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:34,364
ETA 93.7 hours.

151
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:50,212
So, what's your name?

152
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:54,770
Don't talk, don't touch,
don't even breathe...

153
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:58,522
- ... or I kill you. Got it?
- I got it.

154
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,563
Request incoming docking co-ordinates.

155
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,044
please continue holding pattern.

156
00:25:56,373 --> 00:26:02,005

00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,442

161
00:26:15,253 --> 00:26:16,925

Visa file number URFUKD-881.

163
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:24,850
please submit identity.

164
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:29,602
FAKK 2.

165
00:26:29,773 --> 00:26:32,162
Confirmed. Cleared for docking.

166
00:27:07,173 --> 00:27:09,004
You like this place?

167
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:11,330
Looks like a lot of your type.

168
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:16,448
After four days stuck in a Spacehawk,
getting the cold shoulder...

169
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:19,411
...it's not so bad.
We could have a lot of fun here.

170
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:21,609
What are you, socially deprived?

171
00:27:21,693 --> 00:27:25,242
I'm not socially deprived.
Well, maybe a little.

172
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:30,845
"Sit down! What are you looking at?
You snore!

173
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:33,841
"Get outta my face! Shut the fuck up!"

174
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,567
This is heaven compared
to where I come from.

175
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,652
Shut the fuck up.

176
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:51,443
Are you sure this guy Tyler is looking
for a jump port? And to where?

177
00:27:56,213 --> 00:27:59,091
We're talking high-grade,
silicone-rubber flesh here.

178
00:27:59,173 --> 00:28:03,724
And a PVC skeleton with plastic ball
and socket joints for optimum movement.

179
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:07,410
You can customise her
with a choice of seven synthetic hair dyes.

180
00:28:07,493 --> 00:28:11,486
And optional entry ports
with four speeds of suction!

181
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:14,366
Loveable, isn't she?

182
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:17,326
Check this out.

183
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:21,167
She's loaded with the latest micro-sensor
orgasmatronic technology...

184
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:23,409
...and an expandable vocabulary...

185
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,769
...of over 200 dirty words.

186
00:28:26,853 --> 00:28:29,890
Test results indicate
she's better than the real thing.

187
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,131
Go on, Venus.
Show the gentleman what you got.

188
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:39,086
Please select your sexual preference.

189
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:42,802
Vaginal. Anal. Oral. Other.

190
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:45,531
Only 2,000.

191
00:28:46,013 --> 00:28:48,573
I don't know, 2,000...

192
00:28:48,773 --> 00:28:52,243
Unless, of course,
you'd prefer the Fellation Blowfish.

193
00:28:53,053 --> 00:28:57,569
Sick, twisted, low-life, scum sucking pig!

194
00:28:57,893 --> 00:29:00,168
At least I'll have someone to talk to.

195
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:02,249
What?

196
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:05,007
That's him. The tall one.

197
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:10,370
- Let's go.
- I'll wait here.

198
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:13,964
But he'll see me.
You don't know what he's like.

199
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:15,762
Chicken shit.

200
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:07,725
God, this is fun!

201
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,285
Nobody touches these...

202
00:30:32,693 --> 00:30:33,728
...but me!

203
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:36,328
Bar towel!

204
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:54,725
Hello? Captain Tyler,
Metal Mammoth Mining.

205
00:30:54,893 --> 00:30:56,645
We need some drinks!

206
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:04,210
We should make it fast.
We don't want to miss the jump.

207
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:06,161
Screw the jump!

208
00:31:06,613 --> 00:31:08,729
I've got all the time in the world!

209
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:11,452
Besides, something just came up.

210
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:16,647
You just found the man of your dreams.

211
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:23,963
When you kill someone, darling,
make sure he's dead.

212
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:25,962
What the hell?

213
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:16,130
Looks like happy hour is over.

214
00:33:16,973 --> 00:33:20,488
- Who's gonna pay for all of this?
- This ought to take care of it.

215
00:33:20,613 --> 00:33:22,683
Here. Keep the change.

216
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:25,244
What? Holy shit!

217
00:33:25,773 --> 00:33:26,762
Grenades!

218
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:46,928
Julie?

219
00:33:51,653 --> 00:33:53,132
Are you all right?

220
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:59,443
He died! And then he was alive again!

221
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:01,247
Now you know.

222
00:34:02,493 --> 00:34:04,882
I don't know dick! How does he do it?

223
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:06,850
He's got this weird potion!

224
00:34:06,933 --> 00:34:09,447
And a key leading him
to the Chamber of Immortality.

225
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:11,649
Why didn't you tell me that before?

226
00:34:11,773 --> 00:34:14,810
"Sit down. Get outta my face!
Shut the fuck up!"

227
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:21,682
So if I take away his potion,
he'll stay dead, right?

228
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:24,651
If you can get close enough.

229
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,091
That's him, isn't it?

230
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:31,130
Son of a bitch, he's getting away!

231
00:34:31,853 --> 00:34:34,731
What more could the universe want
in a tyrant?

232
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,292
Perfect body, perfect mind.

233
00:34:39,733 --> 00:34:42,691
- Irresistible charm.
- Perfect psycho!

234
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:46,884
Psycho? Time to come out and play.

235
00:34:46,973 --> 00:34:48,691
Don't even think about it!

236
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:55,410
The hyperspace jump.
There's always something.

237
00:34:56,813 --> 00:34:59,247
I'll make it up to you later, sweetheart.

238
00:35:00,573 --> 00:35:03,087
Let me out of here, you bastard!

239
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:22,529
Cortez to Jump Control.
Set lock-in for Uroboris.

240
00:35:22,693 --> 00:35:25,685
No pre-set lock-in. Set co-ordinates.

241
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:29,608
Quadrant 9, sector 4013,
in the Terackian system.

242
00:35:30,013 --> 00:35:31,731
Scanning location.

243
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:35,172
Warning. No return jump port.

244
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:37,444
please confirm lock-in.

245
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,247
Confirmed.

246
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:42,243
It'll take us forever to get back!

247
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,288
That won't be a problem,
once we get there.

248
00:35:48,653 --> 00:35:51,087
We'll never make it!
This thing's a death trap!

249
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:55,843
- It's gotten us this far.
- This far is nowhere.

250
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:58,283
Spacehawk in hyperspace equals death!

251
00:35:58,453 --> 00:35:59,852
Stow the bag.

252
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:26,808
- Are you nuts?
- I'm not going to lose him now.

253
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:57,131
You can't just piggyback their jump!

254
00:37:03,893 --> 00:37:07,408
A tractor beam! Are you insane?
We're going to rip to-

255
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:34,571
- What the hell is that?
- We've got company.

256
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:37,606
Excuse me, "company"?
What do you mean "company"?

257
00:37:37,813 --> 00:37:40,885
See that blip? It's like
somebody hitched onto our jump.

258
00:37:40,973 --> 00:37:45,251
That could change our trajectory.
I want them dead! Now! Take 'em down!

259
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:48,525
But I've never heard of anyone
firing on a ship in hyperspace.

260
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:51,366
Do you have a better idea? Do it! Now!

261
00:37:51,573 --> 00:37:53,131
Man, that's suicide.

262
00:38:03,213 --> 00:38:06,444
- We lost them all. They're toast.
- Send the bomber.

263
00:38:07,893 --> 00:38:10,851
One more word, and I'll send you.

264
00:38:18,653 --> 00:38:21,884
We're hit! I knew it!

265
00:38:22,293 --> 00:38:24,045
This is all your fault!

266
00:38:30,093 --> 00:38:31,606
Do something!

267
00:38:44,773 --> 00:38:46,411
The tunnel's breaking up!

268
00:38:46,893 --> 00:38:49,009
We're not going to make it!

269
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:01,165
Yes! Do it!

270
00:39:31,533 --> 00:39:33,922
I sense the key is here.

271
00:39:35,613 --> 00:39:39,686
For the moment, it is best
if Zeek and I assess the threat alone.

272
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:05,607
My ampoules.

273
00:41:12,173 --> 00:41:14,687
I'm afraid it's down to you.

274
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,643
No. Please.

275
00:41:25,573 --> 00:41:27,245
Lambert, damage report.

276
00:41:29,493 --> 00:41:31,131
I want a damage report!

277
00:41:42,093 --> 00:41:43,651
Don't worry, I'm fine.

278
00:41:44,173 --> 00:41:46,243
Yeah? Like I give a shit!

279
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:49,645
What's the status
on the double D-40s and munitions?

280
00:41:50,213 --> 00:41:51,646
We found a wheel.

281
00:41:51,813 --> 00:41:52,928
Personnel?

282
00:41:54,573 --> 00:41:56,803
Seventy-eight percent dead or missing.

283
00:41:56,893 --> 00:41:58,121
Life-scan?

284
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:04,167
There's a town, looks like
it's about 10 or 12 miles north of here.

285
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,001
Flight status?

286
00:42:06,613 --> 00:42:08,285
You've got to be kidding.

287
00:42:08,453 --> 00:42:10,921
Gather the weapons,
what's left of my men...

288
00:42:11,013 --> 00:42:13,208
...shoot the injured. We're moving on.

289
00:42:41,413 --> 00:42:43,529
Was it good for you?

290
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,604
I'll start you off like this.

291
00:42:48,693 --> 00:42:52,811
The next step, in three or four days,
depending on your production...

292
00:42:52,933 --> 00:42:55,367
...will be the body tank.

293
00:42:57,573 --> 00:42:58,767
You're sick!

294
00:42:59,813 --> 00:43:02,008
I'm a sick genius.

295
00:43:53,453 --> 00:43:54,966
I can't breathe.

296
00:43:55,853 --> 00:43:57,650
Get off my face!

297
00:44:00,693 --> 00:44:01,967
What are you?

298
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:04,362
I'm Zeek, what are you?

299
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:09,971
You're so soft.

300
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,764
I'm harder than you think, stone man.

301
00:44:12,853 --> 00:44:16,562
Please, you must not touch
my master Odin's property.

302
00:44:16,733 --> 00:44:19,611
He's left me with the responsibility
to guard it.

303
00:44:20,013 --> 00:44:23,892
Relax, your thing is safe with me.
Where is your master?

304
00:44:24,013 --> 00:44:25,241
I am Odin.

305
00:44:25,613 --> 00:44:29,891
Please excuse my little friend,
he takes his duties very seriously.

306
00:44:30,013 --> 00:44:33,085
- What are you called?
- FAKK Julie.

307
00:44:34,813 --> 00:44:38,567
Julie, soft. Very soft.

308
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:41,449
You're not from our world, are you?

309
00:44:41,733 --> 00:44:43,928
Hardly. What is this place?

310
00:44:44,413 --> 00:44:48,292
Uroboris. Some call it home.
Others call it hell.

311
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:51,008
My master says you come from the sky.

312
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:53,727
Do you have it? Do you have the key?

313
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:56,204
I don't know anything about a key.

314
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:58,932
I crashed here trying to kill a madman,
who won't die.

315
00:44:59,013 --> 00:45:00,765
I did see two fireballs.

316
00:45:01,373 --> 00:45:04,922
The other was headed in the direction
of a city called Shantaar.

317
00:45:05,853 --> 00:45:08,526
It's not far from here. We'll take you there.

318
00:45:09,613 --> 00:45:11,763
So please, come with us.

319
00:45:12,733 --> 00:45:15,327
Tell me more about this madman.

320
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:20,008
Bastard named Tyler,
killed everyone I ever cared about.

321
00:45:20,213 --> 00:45:24,809
Our legends say that
whoever carries the key, becomes insane.

322
00:45:25,813 --> 00:45:27,610
That's him all right.

323
00:45:29,413 --> 00:45:32,007
I'm sorry. I sense your sadness.

324
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:35,093
It's hard to be the last of your people.

325
00:46:40,373 --> 00:46:43,171
Not much of an army. But it's a start.

326
00:46:43,973 --> 00:46:47,602
Look. The ugliest one seems
to be sitting in my chair.

327
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:14,612
Hey, you, ugly!

328
00:47:16,053 --> 00:47:19,011
Your mother is a Hectarian
whore's handbag!

329
00:47:52,733 --> 00:47:56,123
Molten lava? We have to cross this?

330
00:47:56,413 --> 00:47:59,564
Yes, Shantaar lies on the other side.

331
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,689
- I hate this place.
- How are we going to cross?

332
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:12,248
I am Chartog, guardian of the Red River.

333
00:48:12,573 --> 00:48:14,245
I know the way across...

334
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:17,244
...and I will tell you.

335
00:48:18,773 --> 00:48:20,491
You just have to...

336
00:48:21,893 --> 00:48:23,451
...kiss me.

337
00:48:24,013 --> 00:48:25,082
No way.

338
00:48:26,213 --> 00:48:28,886
What's the matter, my precious?

339
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:33,450
Don't you find me attractive?

340
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,927
If this is what it takes to kill Tyler...

341
00:48:39,413 --> 00:48:42,883
That's a good girl. Help your friends.

342
00:48:43,413 --> 00:48:45,688
It will be over soon.

343
00:48:46,493 --> 00:48:48,927
Who will I have to kiss to get back?

344
00:48:59,613 --> 00:49:01,126
What are you doing?

345
00:49:02,293 --> 00:49:03,851
We're waiting for you.

346
00:49:05,413 --> 00:49:08,405
Son of a bitch! Kiss this!

347
00:49:12,773 --> 00:49:15,241
Your people have strange customs.

348
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:19,011
Tell me about it.

349
00:49:42,973 --> 00:49:46,488
Mortality sucks, immortality sucks.

350
00:49:47,013 --> 00:49:48,651
Everything sucks.

351
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:52,642
Oh, shit.

352
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:56,890
This really sucks.

353
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:32,524
Is he the one you search for?

354
00:50:34,013 --> 00:50:35,048
Oh, yeah.

355
00:50:42,453 --> 00:50:44,284
Yeah! Come on, Tyler!

356
00:50:59,053 --> 00:51:01,726
I'm your new leader! Me!

357
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:10,730
Now we're up the creek.

358
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:24,164
When you kill someone...

359
00:51:26,693 --> 00:51:28,411
...make sure they're dead!

360
00:51:35,773 --> 00:51:36,922
Yo, baby.

361
00:51:48,173 --> 00:51:52,769
I am Tyler! Your new lord!

362
00:52:04,733 --> 00:52:07,884
Blind adulation makes me so horny.

363
00:52:09,053 --> 00:52:10,372
Bring me a wench!

364
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:21,005
Master, he's the one with the key, isn't he?

365
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:25,691
He's far too powerful for us
to deal with alone.

366
00:52:25,773 --> 00:52:27,126
Leave that to me.

367
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:31,804
Julie, you are too impulsive.
Please, think about this.

368
00:52:32,093 --> 00:52:34,527
- Think about what?
- The key.

369
00:52:35,573 --> 00:52:38,724
- You don't understand.
- You worry about the key.

370
00:52:39,093 --> 00:52:40,651
Tyler's mine.

371
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:47,163
She is letting her thirst
for revenge rule her mind.

372
00:53:15,653 --> 00:53:18,008
A little retro, but hey...

373
00:53:28,013 --> 00:53:29,651
Where'd they find you?

374
00:53:30,933 --> 00:53:35,449
I hear you're very special.
I've come a long way to meet you.

375
00:53:39,573 --> 00:53:44,203
- You're not a robot, are you?
- Why don't you find out for yourself?

376
00:53:45,053 --> 00:53:47,772
I could say I've died
and gone to heaven, but...

377
00:53:48,613 --> 00:53:50,285
...that wouldn't be true.

378
00:53:50,653 --> 00:53:54,282
Which part, the dying or the heaven?

379
00:53:57,293 --> 00:53:58,203
You.

380
00:54:03,213 --> 00:54:06,330
I know I'm irresistible,
but what do you want?

381
00:54:06,653 --> 00:54:08,325
I want you...

382
00:54:09,253 --> 00:54:11,164
...and what you have.

383
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,092
There's a price to pay for immortality...

384
00:54:14,253 --> 00:54:16,972
...and the universe is going
to pick up the tab.

385
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,612
How original.

386
00:54:20,213 --> 00:54:22,363
Every king must have a queen.

387
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,292
Do you want me?

388
00:54:26,253 --> 00:54:27,891
Take a wild guess.

389
00:54:32,613 --> 00:54:33,728
Forever?

390
00:54:34,653 --> 00:54:35,768
Shut up.

391
00:54:46,493 --> 00:54:47,926
Not this time!

392
00:54:50,293 --> 00:54:51,328
Bitch!

393
00:54:51,573 --> 00:54:53,404
Time to die!

394
00:54:58,973 --> 00:54:59,883
Die!

395
00:55:05,653 --> 00:55:07,086
What are you doing?

396
00:55:08,293 --> 00:55:12,047
- Stop!
- I can't! The master told me!

397
00:55:15,093 --> 00:55:16,492
You stupid rock!

398
00:55:26,693 --> 00:55:29,651
What does it take to get laid around here?

399
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:34,008
I had him! Ten more seconds,
and he was dead!

400
00:55:34,653 --> 00:55:36,564
We thought you were in trouble.

401
00:55:36,973 --> 00:55:39,692
Julie, it's too late.

402
00:55:40,293 --> 00:55:42,682
It's not just about you and Tyler.

403
00:55:43,533 --> 00:55:47,208
What Tyler seeks lies within the walls
of the Holylands.

404
00:55:48,213 --> 00:55:52,252
He will come and we will all be judged.

405
00:55:53,813 --> 00:55:56,486
What do you mean you can't find them?

406
00:55:57,293 --> 00:56:01,525
How do you lose a 6-foot bitch
with a talking rock?

407
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:04,926
How do you do that?

408
00:56:05,053 --> 00:56:08,409
- We looked everywhere.
- You idiots!

409
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:09,802
Gather the troops!

410
00:56:11,453 --> 00:56:12,966
This is it?

411
00:56:14,493 --> 00:56:18,372
I sure could use a drink
and a little social give and take.

412
00:56:20,813 --> 00:56:22,610
There goes that idea.

413
00:56:38,453 --> 00:56:42,605
Can we stop for a moment?
I'm not as young as I once was.

414
00:56:43,093 --> 00:56:45,004
I'll see what lies beyond.

415
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:50,725
Eden was beautiful.

416
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:53,164
Then he destroyed it.

417
00:56:53,533 --> 00:56:55,842
Master, come see!

418
00:57:20,493 --> 00:57:23,246
It's time for the next phase.

419
00:57:26,253 --> 00:57:27,163
Please.

420
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:30,491
In five minutes, you will lose all senses.

421
00:57:33,573 --> 00:57:36,406
It will seem like a very peaceful dying.

422
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:39,692
What? We have company.

423
00:58:27,653 --> 00:58:28,972
Do you like this?

424
00:58:37,933 --> 00:58:39,764
You shouldn't have done that.

425
00:58:55,893 --> 00:58:58,646
Now I'm really upset!

426
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:06,247
I am worried, Master.
The soft one has been inside too long.

427
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,687
Here, kitty.

428
00:59:11,973 --> 00:59:13,884
I know where you are.

429
00:59:13,973 --> 00:59:16,533
I can smell you.

430
00:59:23,053 --> 00:59:24,168
Help me!

431
00:59:29,213 --> 00:59:32,489
- Kerrie, what about the others?
- They're all dead.

432
00:59:34,453 --> 00:59:35,647
Hang on to me.

433
00:59:41,133 --> 00:59:42,168
It's okay.

434
00:59:43,973 --> 00:59:45,122
Nearly there.

435
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:51,768
Hurry, run!

436
01:00:16,293 --> 01:00:18,124
Isn't that where we crashed?

437
01:00:20,453 --> 01:00:21,772
My ampoules!

438
01:00:31,933 --> 01:00:34,493
I've had it up to here with that bitch!

439
01:00:34,973 --> 01:00:39,808
When I find her, I'll make her immortal
so I can screw her and kill her...

440
01:00:39,973 --> 01:00:43,727
...every hour of every day for all eternity!

441
01:00:44,053 --> 01:00:46,203
We march on the Holyland now!

442
01:00:53,973 --> 01:00:56,692
Where the key goes, horror follows.

443
01:00:56,773 --> 01:00:59,287
All in the sacred name of immortality.

444
01:01:00,453 --> 01:01:01,488
Why us?

445
01:01:01,653 --> 01:01:04,804
Do your ancient books
not teach you about the Arakacians?

446
01:01:04,933 --> 01:01:06,571
We have no ancient books.

447
01:01:06,893 --> 01:01:09,532
They were destroyed
so our people could live in peace...

448
01:01:09,613 --> 01:01:11,729
...without the memory of past evil.

449
01:01:12,893 --> 01:01:16,568
To forget history is
to allow evil to rise again, Julie.

450
01:01:17,093 --> 01:01:19,323
More sinister and ruthless than ever.

451
01:01:19,453 --> 01:01:22,650
- Is Tyler an Arakacian?
- He is not.

452
01:01:22,893 --> 01:01:26,966
Many centuries ago, the Arakacians
discovered an ancient tear...

453
01:01:27,173 --> 01:01:30,529
...in the fabric of the universe
from which flowed a liquid...

454
01:01:30,613 --> 01:01:32,729
...capable of bestowing immortality.

455
01:01:33,293 --> 01:01:37,366
They enslaved my ancestors
and forced them to build a chamber...

456
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:40,963
...in the Holylands to contain
this unnatural power.

457
01:01:41,933 --> 01:01:45,130
And so it was that the Arakacians
ruled in infamy until...

458
01:01:45,213 --> 01:01:50,048
...my people were able to lock the chamber
and cast the key deep into space.

459
01:01:50,853 --> 01:01:55,051
Without their life-giving waters,
the Arakacians became mortal...

460
01:01:55,813 --> 01:01:58,327
...and we were finally able to defeat them.

461
01:01:59,053 --> 01:02:00,884
But now Tyler has the key.

462
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:04,289
Yes. The key which holds
the promise of immortality...

463
01:02:04,413 --> 01:02:07,610
...but also renders its bearer insane.

464
01:02:07,893 --> 01:02:09,531
Such is the curse.

465
01:02:10,613 --> 01:02:13,525
The promise of immortality?
He's already invincible.

466
01:02:13,613 --> 01:02:15,683
No. He is not.

467
01:02:17,013 --> 01:02:20,050
The key is guiding him
to the everlasting waters...

468
01:02:20,173 --> 01:02:21,925
...but he has yet to reach them.

469
01:02:22,013 --> 01:02:24,049
Why did he have to destroy Eden?

470
01:02:24,253 --> 01:02:27,131
The Arakacians also occupied your colony...

471
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:31,122
...and stored some of the liquid there
as they ravaged the universe.

472
01:02:31,733 --> 01:02:33,883
Over time it seeped into the earth.

473
01:02:34,053 --> 01:02:37,204
Your people absorbed traces of it
into their systems.

474
01:02:37,493 --> 01:02:39,882
Which Tyler distilled from their bodies!

475
01:02:41,293 --> 01:02:43,523
Not enough to render him immortal...

476
01:02:43,613 --> 01:02:46,411
...but now he has the strength
to reach the chamber.

477
01:02:46,493 --> 01:02:49,963
A whole people destroyed
because of the lust for power of one man.

478
01:02:50,413 --> 01:02:54,247
It has happened before, Julie.
It will happen again.

479
01:02:55,413 --> 01:02:56,687
Not with Tyler.

480
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:51,563
Welcome back, Master Odin!

481
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:09,603
- Odin, the key? Is it here?
- I'm afraid so.

482
01:04:10,253 --> 01:04:11,971
As we speak, the carrier...

483
01:04:12,053 --> 01:04:15,682
...and the vile scum of Shantaar
descend upon our city.

484
01:04:16,573 --> 01:04:20,646
We have done all we can to prepare.
We will fight to the death.

485
01:06:02,773 --> 01:06:04,331
You know each other?

486
01:06:04,533 --> 01:06:06,569
He tried to save me at the school.

487
01:06:07,093 --> 01:06:08,412
It was nothing.

488
01:06:09,773 --> 01:06:11,411
And where did you meet?

489
01:06:12,053 --> 01:06:13,202
We're sisters.

490
01:06:14,453 --> 01:06:15,568
Sisters!

491
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:19,526
The elders have been killed!
There's a traitor among us!

492
01:06:19,613 --> 01:06:20,887
Warn the others!

493
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:24,448
There it is.

494
01:06:25,653 --> 01:06:29,202
The Chamber of Immortality,
that holds the everlasting waters.

495
01:07:07,453 --> 01:07:08,647
The last one.

496
01:07:35,573 --> 01:07:38,007
Everybody fight! Come on!

497
01:08:29,253 --> 01:08:30,732
This is going to suck!

498
01:09:38,853 --> 01:09:40,002
You fool!

499
01:09:40,573 --> 01:09:42,609
That was my last one!

500
01:10:34,933 --> 01:10:37,686
- Thank you, soft one.
- Anytime.

501
01:10:55,373 --> 01:10:56,522
Hey, asshole!

502
01:10:58,093 --> 01:10:59,128
You again!

503
01:11:54,213 --> 01:11:55,771
Did you miss me?

504
01:12:10,933 --> 01:12:13,242
You always hurt the ones you love.

505
01:12:13,613 --> 01:12:14,841
Like this?

506
01:12:24,813 --> 01:12:28,522
Hold that pose. I'll be right back.

507
01:12:54,573 --> 01:12:58,043
It's mine. It's all mine!

508
01:13:17,373 --> 01:13:21,161
Bring it on, bitch!
You're really starting to piss me off!

509
01:13:21,533 --> 01:13:24,650
You are not worthy of the Holy Waters!

510
01:13:26,253 --> 01:13:27,322
Not today.

511
01:13:52,093 --> 01:13:54,766
Remember this on your way to hell!

512
01:13:57,693 --> 01:13:58,967
FAKK 2!

513
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:04,562
The insanity has to end now.

514
01:14:10,213 --> 01:14:12,204
We must destroy the key.

515
01:14:14,013 --> 01:14:15,412
Perhaps not!

516
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:21,288
Why?

517
01:14:22,413 --> 01:14:26,964
Because I am Arakacian!

518
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:30,444
My charade fooled
the insufferable Holylanders!

519
01:14:30,653 --> 01:14:32,530
And even that little stone idiot!

520
01:14:32,613 --> 01:14:35,571
What makes you think
a pathetic mortal could stop me?

521
01:15:09,413 --> 01:15:10,971
You fools!

522
01:15:34,653 --> 01:15:36,928
I must fulfil my destiny.

523
01:15:58,453 --> 01:16:01,365
- You must!
- Zeek, I command you!

524
01:16:10,893 --> 01:16:14,408
Good-bye, soft one. I'll never forget you.

525
01:16:47,773 --> 01:16:48,808
It's over.

526
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:57,526
- Let me help you.
- Oh, no. He survived.

527
01:16:58,493 --> 01:16:59,642
Are you okay?

528
01:17:00,293 --> 01:17:02,807
What does it look like, you dickhead?

529
01:17:11,333 --> 01:17:14,769
Eternity is a long time to spend alone.

530
01:17:15,453 --> 01:17:17,205
What are you talking about?

531
01:17:18,653 --> 01:17:21,247
Does this mean
we're all going to be immortal?

532
01:17:22,213 --> 01:17:24,010
'Cause if that's true, you know...

533
01:17:24,093 --> 01:17:26,732
Listen, I'm going to be around
for a long time.

534
01:17:27,413 --> 01:17:28,766
Who took the key?

535
01:17:29,253 --> 01:17:31,050
Does this mean we're friends now?

536
01:17:31,133 --> 01:17:33,931
'Cause I've been putting up
with a lot of your crap, so...

537
01:17:34,573 --> 01:17:37,929
...I think it's payback time.
Come on, you know you love me.

538
01:17:56,773 --> 01:18:01,051
And so the key to the chamber
of immortality...

539
01:18:01,133 --> 01:18:05,968
...was once again cast out
into the silent gulfs of space...

540
01:18:07,573 --> 01:18:12,567
...with a new stone protector
to guard it against evil.
